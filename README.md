**1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction:**  
I‚Äôm thrilled to share my experience in implementing a robust and scalable three-tier web architecture on AWS. This project covered key aspects like networking, security, database deployment, load balancing, and auto-scaling.

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Configuration:**
- **Download Code from GitHub:** Cloned the repository containing all necessary dependencies.
- **S3 Bucket Creation:** Set up an S3 bucket to store application assets and configuration files.
- **IAM EC2 Instance Role Creation:** Established an IAM role for EC2 instances, granting secure access to AWS services.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Networking and Security:**
- **VPC and Subnets:** Designed a VPC and subnets to segment the network, enhancing security.
- **Internet Connectivity:** Implemented an Internet Gateway to ensure internet access.
- **Routing Configuration:** Configured route tables for efficient traffic management.
- **NAT Gateway:** Deployed a NAT Gateway to allow secure internet access for instances in private subnets.
- **Security Groups:** Defined security groups based on the principle of least privilege to control instance traffic.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Database Setup:**  
- **Subnet Groups:** Created subnet groups for high availability across multiple availability zones.
- **Database Deployment:** Leveraged Amazon Aurora for a scalable, managed database solution.

**5Ô∏è‚É£ App Tier Instance Setup:**  
- **App Instance Deployment:** Launched EC2 instances for the application tier.
- **Connect to Instance:** Used Session Manager to configure the environment and deploy the application.
- **Configure Database:** Established secure and efficient database connections.
- **Configure App Instance:** Installed necessary dependencies and configured application settings.
- **Test App Tier:** Thoroughly tested the application tier for functionality and performance.

**6Ô∏è‚É£ Internal Load Balancing and Auto Scaling:**
- **App Tier AMI:** Created an AMI of the configured application instance for seamless scaling.
- **Target Group:** Established a target group to route traffic based on health checks.
- **Internal Load Balancer:** Deployed to distribute traffic evenly among app tier instances.
- **Launch Template:** Streamlined instance launches with predefined configurations.
- **Auto Scaling:** Dynamically adjusted the number of instances based on traffic patterns.

**7Ô∏è‚É£ Web Tier Instance Setup:**
- **Update Config File:** Updated configuration files specifically for the web tier.
- **Web Instance Deployment:** Launched EC2 instances dedicated to the web tier.
- **Connect to Instance:** Used Session Manager to configure the environment and deploy web server software.
- **Configure Web Instance:** Optimized performance and ensured robust security settings.
